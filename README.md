# README - Gym Management System

## Introduction
Gym management software or fitness software is a software solution that helps businesses to streamline, organize, and run their operations. While you can have a wide range of functionality, most gym management systems offer both admin and a client-facing portal. The platform allows gym owners to manage their facilities and members better. 

## Problem Statement
Gym owners find it hard to keep up with their client's information as well as the trainers and equipment in the facility.
Most gyms maintain their client's records manually but digital record handling has shown to be more efficient, cost-effective, and provides easy maintenance.

## Solution
We have come up with a system that will enable gym owners to run their facilities efficiently ensuring that they keep their clients satisfied as well as their employees. This will allow them to run a profitable business. At the same time, the system will try and cater to all client needs within a gym environment.
